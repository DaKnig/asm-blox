# asm-blox: a programming game inspired by WAT and YAML

  Solve a variety of puzzles involving moving data using WAT and YAML.
  The game is played on a 3x4 grid where each grid can hold 11 lines
  of text.  Nodes can send to adjacent notes number values.  Using
  YAML, you can define extra components such as stacks and heaps to
  help you solve your puzzles.
